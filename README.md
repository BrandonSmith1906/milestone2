Holidays 4U
. 
 
 
 
Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
UX
This website is for external users who would like to get great prices on the best quality hotels, it is useful as they can search any country in the world for hotels and it will give them a selection of many places to accommodate themselves. They simply search the area they’re looking to stay in and simply choose a hotel; it also comes with information on cruises & family packages.
Features
I have my navigation bar which is at the top of my website; users will use this to get to their desired page (it will scroll down to their section).
There is a world map which allows users to search for hotels/accommodations in any city.
I have a contact section for users to leave a message if necessary.
A section for services, informing users on deals and other types of vacations. 
Finally we have a hot packages area which allows customers to read up on our 3 main deals.
Existing Features
There are no other existing features however I may consider in the future adding a link to flights or even my own flights board.

Testing
My website has been tested on many browsers such as ‘Firefox, internet explorer, google chrome & google’ it has worked on a dell laptop, a ThinkPad & a mac. This website has also worked on other devices such as a tablet & an iPhone as I made the website responsive. 

Deployment
•	I deployed my website on github, normally I would git commit my work through the bottom of my cloud9 workspace but I took a different approach this time as I put the code into notes then uploaded them as files onto git.
I can locally run my code on my cloud 9 aws
